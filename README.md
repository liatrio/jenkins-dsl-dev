# jenkins-dsl-dev
Repository with Docker for use in Jenkins Groovy DSL development

### Developing the Pipeline
To help develop this pipeline, a Docker container has been provided.  Follow these steps to begin using the container locally to test your changes to the pipeline.
##### Prerequisites - [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)

#### Step #Do-it: Clone the repository and start the container
```
git clone https://github.com/liatrio/jenkins-dsl-dev.git
cd jenkins-dsl-dev
docker-compose up
```
The first time this is run, the container will be built before starting which may take a few minutes.  This process will install all plugins currently required.

##### New plugins can be added to the plugin list in the [Dockerfile](./jenkins/Dockerfile)

##### All of the build jobs can be generated by running the "seedjob" within [Jenkins - http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (user: admin | password: admin)
##### Changes to the pipeline will be picked up automatically with each run of the seed job
